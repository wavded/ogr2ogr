# ogr2ogr [![Build Status](https://jenkins.adc4gis.com/buildStatus/icon?job=ogr2ogr)](https://jenkins.adc4gis.com/job/ogr2ogr/)

ogr2ogr enables spatial file conversion and reprojection of spatial data through the use of ogr2ogr (gdal) tool

## Requirements

ogr2ogr requires the command line tool *ogr2ogr* - [gdal install page](http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries).
It is recommended to use the latest version.

## Installation

    npm install ogr2ogr

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/ogr2ogr.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/ogr2ogr)

## Usage

ogr2ogr takes either a path, a stream, or a GeoJSON object.  The result of the transformation can be consumed via callback or stream:

```js
var ogr2ogr = require('ogr2ogr')
var ogr = ogr2ogr('/path/to/spatial/file')

ogr.exec(function (er, data) {
  if (er) console.error(er)
  console.log(data)
})

var ogr2 = ogr2ogr('/path/to/another/spatial/file')
ogr2.stream().pipe(writeStream)
```

See `/examples` for usage examples and `/test/api.js`.

## Formats

The goal is for ogr2ogr to support most (if not all) formats your underlying ogr2ogr supports.  You can see the progress of that in `/tests/drivers.js`.

It also will:

1.  Extract zip files for formats that are typically bundled (i.e. shapefiles, kmz, s57, vrt, etc)
2.  Will extract geometry from CSVs when a common geometry field can be determined.
3.  Cleans up after its messes.
4.  Bundles multi-file conversions as a zip
5.  Support GeoJSON and GeoRSS urls as path inputs
6.  Support raw GeoJSON objects as input

## Options

ogr2ogr takes chainable modifier functions:

```js
var shapefile = ogr2ogr('/path/to/spatial/file.geojson')
					.format('ESRI Shapefile')
					.skipfailures()
					.stream()
shapefile.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('/shapefile.zip'))
```

Available options include:

* `.project(dest, src)` - reproject data (defaults to: "ESPG:4326")
* `.format(fmt)` - set output format (defaults to: "GeoJSON")
* `.timeout(ms)` - milliseconds before ogr2ogr is killed (defaults to: 15000)
* `.skipfailures()` - skip failures (continue after failure, skipping failed feature -- by default failures are not skipped)
* `.append()` - append to existing layer instead of creating new if it exists
* `.update()` - open existing output datasource in update mode
* `.options(arr)` - array of custom org2ogr arguments (e.g. `['-fieldmap', '2,-1,4']`)
* `.destination(str)` -  ogr2ogr destination (directly tell ogr2ogr where the output should go, useful for writing to databases)
